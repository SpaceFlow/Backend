# Spaceflow Backend
Spaceflow is an Open-Source realtime, community moderated, social network. The backend uses many different independet modules and a MySQL Cluster as Backend,
which results in a very high scalability. The main part of the backend is a centralized management server from which
every node (server) can gather the addresses of every other registered node. It also supports a flagging system with realtime
updates.
